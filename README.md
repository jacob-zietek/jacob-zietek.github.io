# Hey, welcome to the documentation for this site.

## Why is this a thing?

I wanted a place to write my thoughts into markdown files and have them automatically uploaded to a website. I guess other people have had this thought before because [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a thing. It does all of the markdown &rarr;Â HTML stuff for you :thumbsup:. There are some things that need to be configured every time you add a markdown file still, so the [run.py](https://github.com/jacob-zietek/jacob-zietek.github.io/blob/main/run.py) script automates adding the links to [index.md](https://github.com/jacob-zietek/jacob-zietek.github.io/blob/main/index.md) and [_config.yml](https://github.com/jacob-zietek/jacob-zietek.github.io/blob/main/_config.yml).

Special thanks to this guy &rarr;  https://nicolas-van.github.io/easy-markdown-to-github-pages/
