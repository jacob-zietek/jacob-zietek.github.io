# Hey, welcome to the documentation for this site.

## Why is this a thing?

I wanted a place to write my thoughts into markdown files and have them automatically uploaded to a website. I guess other people have had this thought before because [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a thing. It does all of the markdown &rarr; HTML stuff for you 👍.

Special thanks to Drew
