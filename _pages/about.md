<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

<!-- I'm a Senior Research Scientist at Google DeepMind where I work on the Robotics team. I received my PhD degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University. I was co-advised by Silvio Savarese in SVL and Leo Guibas. I was supported by Stanford Graduate Fellowship and Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship. During my PhD, I have done research internships with Dieter Fox at Nvidia, Alexander Toshev and Brian Ichter at Google. I obtained my bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University in 2016. [formal bio in EN/CN]
Research Interest
My mission is to build intelligent embodied agents that can interact with complex and unstructured real-world environments, with applications to home robotics. I have been approaching this problem from 3 aspects: 1) Large scale and transferrable simulation for Robotics. 2) Learning algorithms for long-horizon tasks. 3) Combining geometric and semantic representation for environments. Most recently, I have been exploring using foundation models for robot decision making.
Outreach
On weekends, depending on availability, I voluntarily host office hours for students (especially underrepresented groups and junior students) who want to get into the field of and develop a career on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics. Each slot is 20-minute long. If you want to get advice from me, please fill out this questionnaire. -->


## **About me**

I'm an AI Engineer at [Armada](https://www.armada.ai/ai) where I work on EdgeAI.

I have done internships with [Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/health-services), [Shield AI](https://shield.ai/jets/), [PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/), and [BNL](https://www.bnl.gov/world/) during my undergrad @ Purdue. 

A bulk of my undergraduate research was under [Professor Ahmed Qureshi](https://qureshiahmed.github.io/) at [CoRAL Lab](https://corallab.net/).

## **Interests**

My beliefs are that AI and robotics will eventually replace humans in boring and dangerous tasks. This is something we should welcome with open arms, and help accelerate as much as possible.

I’m passionate about integrating AI into our daily lives. My main interests are in collaborative decision-making between autonomous systems and humans. I enjoy building systems the general population can interact with directly. Naturally, the main fields I’m most interested in are AI, robotics, and human-robot interaction. 

As of late I've been focused on using foundational models in language and vision for collaborative planning and decision making.

I'm constantly looking for opportunities to contribute to interesting projects, dm me :)

## **Mentorship**

I come from a pretty unique background where I had to figure a lot of stuff out on my own. If you do too, and I can help in any way, fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/a1bR1UGDXm39g6Kz9) and shoot me an email. I check everything regularly.
