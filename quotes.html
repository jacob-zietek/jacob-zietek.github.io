        <p>If, as the official Google line claims, this LaMDA AI is simply imitating human dialogue patterns, then we
            also have a philosophical problem with the question of when babies become conscious beings. Babies also
            learn through imitation. When do they have minds? AI researchers are going to hit this one repeatedly.

            Participate. Exert yourself. -<em>Epictetus</em></p>
