        <p>Technical interview questions are hard. It comes naturally to some– I am not one of those people. In this
            post I’ll be going over some of the tips and tricks I’ve picked up over the last few years to improve in
            this domain.</p>

        <h6>Note from Aug 19 2024: This one's a little cringe to read but it's ok. I wrote it after I got my Amazon
            internship for incoming freshmen+sophomores. Just watch neetcode.</h6>

        <p>Technical interviews have become the norm for any company somewhat related to tech. With such a huge talent
            pool and limited spots at top companies, you’ll be answering at least one leetcode question to even be
            considered.</p>

        <p>Leetcode style questions are daunting at first, but once you dip your toes in you’ll soon realize they’re all
            a subset of a few different patterns. Those being…</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arrays</li>
            <li>Binary manipulation</li>
            <li>Dynamic programming</li>
            <li>Graphs</li>
            <li>Intervals</li>
            <li>Linked lists</li>
            <li>Matricies</li>
            <li>Strings</li>
            <li>Heaps</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With consistent practice over a long period of time, you’ll learn how to apply various techniques to solve
            these patterns. You’ll also learn how to identify these problem patterns within the long-winded prompts of
            leetcode questions.</p>
        <p>When I first started prepping for technical interviews I didn’t have a direction. I started doing random
            questions on the front page of leetcode and was surprised to see that I wasn’t learning anything :trollface:
            In order to properly dive into technical interview preparation, it’s best to have a plan and some sort of
            structure.</p>
        <p>I recommend doing 2-4 problems a day from the Blind75. I have a template for you to follow here, this will
            allow you to take notes and track your progress on your journey <img class="emoji" title=":point_right:"

        <p>It’s best to do a range of different categories and difficulties a day. <strong>Do what’s harder for you now,
                so you’ll be prepared for the future.</strong> Try each problem for a good 30-45 minutes. If you’re
            still stuck, look at the discussion or the solution tab to see how others approached the problem. Seeing how
            others solved it helps you understand the intuition behind some of the techniques. Leetcode premium (or a
            shared account <img class="emoji" title=":wink:" alt=":wink:"
                src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png" height="20" width="20">) is a
            sound investment for this. There are also plenty of youtube channels that go over some of the most common
            problems (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NeetCode" rel="external nofollow noopener"
                target="_blank">NeetCode</a>)</p>
        <p>You might have to review Data Structures and Algorithms content for any of this to make sense. If you haven’t
            taken a course yet, it might be best to do that either through your school or virtually. There are plenty of
            free resources out there, choose one that suits you. A fan favorite is <a
                href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1" rel="external nofollow noopener"
                target="_blank">Princeton’s coursera course</a>.</p>
        <p>You’re moreso trying to learn how to <em>approach</em> these problems and identify when to use certain
            techniques/algorithms rather than memorizing a solution for every problem. Expose yourself to as many
            problems as you can.</p>
        <p>If you’re on a particularly short timeframe, it’s possible to cram but your results will vary. The learning
            process is often slow for these problems. It might be best to no-life leetcode for a bit if your interview
            is particularly close.</p>
        <p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/29bxxm1ubzn81.png?auto=webp&amp;s=00af81ea7b2818d72a9d6ab7b07efe6a543eb381"

        <p>Your mileage will vary with just these types of questions, but these are standard for FAANG and other big
            name companies. You will see various take home, design, and general knowledge based questions come up as
            well (If you’re applying for an ML role, know ML)! Do your due diligence and be flexible in your preparation
            to suit your own goals.</p>
        <p>There will also likely be non-technical/behavioral questions. The best guide I’ve seen to answering these
            have been in the book <a
                href="https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition-189-Programming-Questions-and-Solutions.pdf"
                rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>. In my experience,
            though, the best way to prepare for this is through experience. You’re not just a code monkey <img
                class="emoji" title=":monkey_face:" alt=":monkey_face:"
                src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f435.png" height="20" width="20">
            You’ll need to be able to fluently talk about your past experiences in classes, personal projects, and
            internships. Software Engineering and related fields are social jobs. Explaining your code both precisely
            and in high level terms is a necessary skill you’ll need to develop.</p>
        <p>The path to conquering technical interviews is long, frustrating, and tedious. However you may feel about
            them, technical interviews are here to stay. There are two options: <strong>adapt or die</strong></p>
