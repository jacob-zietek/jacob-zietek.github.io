    <h1>How do I start working out?</h1>
    <h2>February 17, 2022</h2>
    <div id="markdown-content">
        <p>A lot of people have approached me since I started working out for advice on how to start out. This is both
            endearing and a little odd since I’m miles away from Arnold <img class="emoji" title=":muscle:"
                alt=":muscle:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4aa.png" height="20"
                width="20">. The demographic also tends to be people in STEM, so I’m glad we’re working on killing
            stereotypes. I still consider myself a beginner. Nonetheless, I wanted to record some of the things I’ve
            learned since starting my fitness journey and some of the common advice I dish out. This is by no means a
            comprehensive guide, fitness is a life long journey.</p>

        <h6>Note from Dec. 24 2023: I didn’t fully stick with this when I started really focusing on research, but I
            wish
            I did, and you should!</h6>

        <h2 id="why-is-it-important-to-you">Why is it important to you?</h2>
        <p>Fitness and working out has incredible <a
                href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470658/#:~:text=Exercise%20improves%20mental%20health%20by,self%2Desteem%20and%20cognitive%20function.&amp;text=Exercise%20has%20also%20been%20found,self%2Desteem%20and%20social%20withdrawal."
                rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">benefits</a> on your mental and physical health.
            It’s
            an avenue to increase your cognition, self-esteem, and strength (among other things) all in one place.
            Your
            reward for working out is proportional to the amount of effort you put in.</p>
        <p>Once you get over the initial hump, exercise is <a
                href="https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression#:~:text=When%20you%20exercise%2C%20your%20body,similar%20to%20that%20of%20morphine."
                rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">addicting</a>. It feels good to move your body, to
            abolish mental obstacles we place on ourselves, and to watch your body transform as you put the work in.
            The
            gym is a place I’ll always feel home in.</p>
        <p><em>“It is a disgrace to grow old through sheer carelessness before seeing what manner of man you may
                become
                by developing your bodily strength and beauty to their highest limit.”</em> -Socrates</p>
        <h2 id="what-should-i-do">What should I do?</h2>
        <p>The worst thing you can do is wait. A lot of common things you hear from those who never start is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I’m too busy!</li>
            <li>School’s taking up all of my time.</li>
            <li>I need time to relax.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Everyone has free time to some degree. I’m guilty of cutting down gym time severely for studying
            technical
            interviews and exams. However busy times get, you always have some time to commit to the gym. Even 15-30
            minutes messing around with machines helps form a habit.</p>
        <p>Instead of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scrolling on social media</li>
            <li>Watching youtube/tv/twitch</li>
            <li>Chatting on discord</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Go to the gym!</em></p>
        <p>You probably have more free time than you think. Just showing up matters so, so, much. Without the
            discipline
            or drive to show up you won’t get far.</p>
        <h2 id="what-routine-do-i-follow">What routine do I follow?</h2>
        <p>This all depends on your goal. I only know about muscle building (focused on hypertrophy), some other
            goals
            include</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.coachmag.co.uk/full-body-workouts/6960/six-week-strength-training-workout-plan"
                    rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Strength</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.mcmillanrunning.com/best-5k-workout/" rel="external nofollow noopener"
                    target="_blank">Cardiovascular</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I don’t do any strength or cardiovascular training on its own, but above are good links for both. I
            recommend
            doing extra research and planning a routine that best suits you (and if you’d like, reach out to me and
            I’ll
            help you)</p>
        <p>For muscle building, you’ll typically want to run a PPL (push pull legs) split. You’re grouping the
            pushing
            and pulling muscles into either own day, and you do legs on another day.</p>
        <p>This will allow you to maximize the amount of workouts you can do, since your workouts generally won’t
            overlap with other days and your muscles will have adequate enough time to rest.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.aston.ac.uk/sport/news/tips/fitness-exercise/push-pull-legs#:~:text=What%20Is%20The%20Push%2FPull,the%20chest%2C%20shoulders%20and%20triceps."
                rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Here’s a link</a> to a schedule that’s good for a
            PPL
            schedule.</p>
        <p>The most important thing to understand while working out for muscle building is the concept of <a
                href="https://www.healthline.com/health/progressive-overload#:~:text=Progressive%20overload%20is%20when%20you,musculoskeletal%20system%20to%20get%20stronger.&amp;text=With%20progressive%20overload%2C%20you%20may%20notice%20you%20feel%20fitter%20and%20stronger."
                rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>progressive overload</em></a>. Progressive
            overload, in short, means you progressively add on more volume or weight to your workouts as time goes
            on.
            If one week you can curl 15lbs for 8 repetitions for 4 sets, try 9 repetitions the next week! This will
            place more stress on your muscles as time goes on. As you get stronger your exercises should get harder.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Your workouts should never be easy.</strong></p>
        <p>If you’re using a premade schedule and you don’t know what an exercise is, google a YouTube tutorial.
            Don’t
            be afraid to try and substitute exercises in that you think look cool!</p>
        <h2 id="what-should-i-eat">What should I eat?</h2>
        <p>Building muscle or burning fat starts in the kitchen. Without a proper diet, all of your progress in the
            gym
            is nullified.</p>
        <p>I like to follow a loose-ish diet. That doesn’t mean I eat everything I want, and it certainly doesn’t
            mean
            that don’t take nutrition seriously.</p>
        <p>I approach dieting by starting with my caloric maintenance (<a
                href="https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html" rel="external nofollow noopener"
                target="_blank">calculate here</a>). I eat 500 calories below for a cut (losing fat while trying to
            maintain muscle) and I eat 300-400 calories above for bulking (gaining minimal fat and gaining muscle).
            I
            have a set protein goal I want to hit (1 gram of protein per lb of bodyweight) and I do so with
            different
            foods.</p>
        <p>I eat out often and I cook often, but my eating revolves around those two things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My caloric goal</li>
            <li>My protein goal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I log all of my meals in <a href="">MyFitnessPal app</a> to make sure I’m hitting all of my goals. This
            is
            probably the most important thing I do, since keeping track of everything mentally is nearly impossible.
            It’s possible to go over your goal on some days and under on others as long as your dieting is pretty
            constant, it’s important to maintain a good relationship with food throughout all of this. Your weekly
            average should be about the same in terms of calories and protein.</p>
        <p>For most people dieting seems impossible, and I’d be lying if I said this wasn’t the hardest part to
            learn
            from my fitness journey after binge eating myself from 140lb <img class="emoji" title=":arrow_right:"
                alt=":arrow_right:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/27a1.png"
                height="20" width="20"> 180lb in one year. There were quite a few things I learned to make this more
            manageable:</p>

            <li>Multivitamins</li>

        <p>Supplements are pretty personalized and everyone will tell you different things, but I’d recommend:</p>
