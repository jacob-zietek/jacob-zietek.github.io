I wanted to share my results so hopefully others can learn from it later. I applied as a Bachelors student straight into Ph.D. programs. My field was CS/AI/ML/Robotics.

Recieved 1 Excellent and 4 Very Good scores for Intellectual Merit, 5 Very Good scores for Broader Impacts.

Result: No honorable mention or award.

[My background](/assets/pdf/grfp_background.pdf), [my proposal](/assets/pdf/grfp_proposal.pdf), and [my reviews](/assets/pdf/grfp_reviews.pdf).

Reach out if I can help in any way :^) Good luck!
