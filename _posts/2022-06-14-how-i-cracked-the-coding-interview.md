Tech interview questions are hard. It comes naturally to some, I am not one of those people. In this post I'll be going over some of the tips and tricks I've picked up to improve in this domain.

Technical interviews have become the norm for any company remotely related to tech. With such a high talent pool and limited spots at top companies, you'll be answering at least one leetcode question to even be considered.

Leetcode style questions are daunting at first, but once you dip your toes in you'll soon realize they're all a subset of a few different patterns. Those being...

- Arrays
- Binary manipulation
- Dynamic programming
- Graphs
- Intervals
- Linked lists
- Matricies
- Strings
- Heaps

With consistent practice over a long period of time, you'll soon learn how to apply various techniques to solve these patterns. You'll also learn how to identify these patterns within the long-winded prompts of leetcode questions.

When I first started prepping for technical interviews I didn't have a direction. I started doing random questions on the front page of leetcode and was surprised to see that I wasn't learning anything :trollface: In order to properly dive into leetcode prep, it's best to have a plan and some sort of structure.

I recommend doing 2-4 problems a day of the Blind75. I have a great template for you to follow here :point_right: [the link!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zvKUnaP_u1BweThWhCWrfAtRJBGkruH1Dc_AzR9lJyk/edit?usp=sharing))

It's best to do a range of different categories and difficulties a day. Do what's harder for you now, so you'll be prepared for the future. Try each problem for a good 30-45 minutes. If you're still stuck, look at the discussion or solution tab to see how others approached the problem. Seeing how others solved it helps you understand the intuition behind some of the techniques. Leetcode premium (or a shared account :wink:) is a sound investment for this. There are also plenty of youtube channels that discuss some of the most common problems (like Neetcode).

You might have to review Data Structures and Algorithms content for any of this to make sense. If you haven't taken a course yet, it might be best to do that either through your school or virtually. There are plenty of free resources out there, choose one that suits you. A fan favorite is [Princeton's coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1).

You're moreso trying to learn how to approach these problems and identify when to use certain techniques/algorithms rather than memorizing a solution for every problem. Expose yourself to as many problems as you can. 

If you're on a particularly short timeframe, it's possible to cram but your results will vary. The learning process is often slow for these problems. It might be best to no-life leetcode for a bit if your interview is particularly close.

Your milage will vary with just these types of questions, but these are standard for FAANG and other big name companies. You will see various take home, design, and general knowledge based questions come up as well (If you're applying for an ML role, know ML!). It's up to you to do your due diligence and be flexible in your preparation to suit your own goals.

The path to conquering technical interviews is long, frustrating, and tedious. However you may feel about them, technical interviews are here to stay. There are two options: adapt or die.
