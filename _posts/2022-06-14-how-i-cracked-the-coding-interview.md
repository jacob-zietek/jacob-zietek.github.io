Tech interview questions are hard. It comes naturally to some; I am not one of those people. In this post I'll be going over some of the tips and tricks I've picked up to improve in this domain.

Technical interviews have become the norm for any interiew. With such a high talent pool and limited spots at top companies, you'll be answering at least one leetcode question to even be considered.

Leetcode style questions are daunting at first, but once you dip your toes in you'll soon realize they're all a subset of a few different patterns. Those being...

- Arrays
- Binary manipulation
- Dynamic programming
- Graphs
- Intervals
- Linked lists
- Matricies
- Strings
- Heaps

With consistent practice over a long period of time, you'll soon learn how to apply various techniques to solve these patterns. You'll also learn how to identify these patterns within the long-winded prompts of leetcode questions.

Your milage will vary with just these types of questions though, but these are standard for FAANG and other big name companies. You will see various take home, design, and general knowledge based questions come up as well. It's up to you to do your due diligence and be flexible in your preparation to suit your own goals.

As a short TLDR...
Do 2-4 problems a day of the Blind75 (I have a good template for you to follow [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zvKUnaP_u1BweThWhCWrfAtRJBGkruH1Dc_AzR9lJyk/edit?usp=sharing)) and try to do a good amount of unique categories and difficulties. Try each problem for a good 30-45 minutes. If you're still stuck, look at the discussion/solution tab to see how other people approached the problem and understand the methodology. Try it again now knowing how to approach the problem. You might have to review Data Structures and Algorithms content, or take a class through school or virtually for this to make any sense. There are only a few different patterns in Leetcode. You're moreso trying to learn how to approach those problems and identify when to use certain techniques rather than memorizing a solution for every problem. Expose yourself to as many problems as you can. If you're on a short timeframe, it's possible to cram but your results will vary. It might be best to no-life it for a bit if your interview is particularly close.
