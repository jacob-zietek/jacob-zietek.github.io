    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>I'm currently living in Houston and working on embodied ai at <a href="https://personainc.ai/">Persona AI</a> as one of the founding engineers.</p>
    <p> I was previously at <a href="https://www.armada.ai/product/ai">Armada</a>, and have done
        internships with <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.shield.ai">Shield
            AI</a>, <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov">PNNL</a>, and <a href="https://www.bnl.gov">BNL</a>.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Purdue CS in December 2023. A bulk of my undergraduate research was under <a
            href="https://qureshiahmed.github.io">Professor
            Ahmed
            Qureshi</a> at <a href="https://corallab.net">CoRAL Lab</a>.</p>
    <p>I love taking risks and taking non-linear paths in life.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>AI and robots will eventually replace humans in boring and dangerous tasks.
        This is
        something we should welcome with open arms, and help accelerate as much as possible.</p>
    <p>I’m passionate about integrating AI into our daily lives. My main interests are in collaborative
        decision-making
        between autonomous systems and humans. I enjoy building systems the general population can interact
        with
        directly. Naturally, the main fields I’m most interested in are AI, robotics, and human-robot
        interaction.</p>
    <p>My other technical interests are in space and defense. I have a gut feeling I'll end up working on space robots
        once space is commercialized more.</p>

    <p>I love keeping up with the startup world & am
        interested in angel investing.</p>
