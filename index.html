    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I’m currently an AI Engineer at <a href="https://www.armada.ai/product/ai">Armada</a> where I work on various
        real-time
        computer vision applications. I graduated from Purdue Computer Science in December 2023 and live in San
        Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>I have done internships with <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.shield.ai">Shield
            AI</a>, <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov">PNNL</a>, and <a href="https://www.bnl.gov">BNL</a>
        during my
        undergrad @ Purdue.</p>
    <p>A bulk of my undergraduate research was under <a href="https://qureshiahmed.github.io">Professor
            Ahmed
            Qureshi</a> at <a href="https://corallab.net">CoRAL Lab</a>.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>My beliefs are that AI and robotics will eventually replace humans in boring and dangerous tasks.
        This is
        something we should welcome with open arms, and help accelerate as much as possible.</p>
    <p>I’m passionate about integrating AI into our daily lives. My main interests are in collaborative
        decision-making
        between autonomous systems and humans. I enjoy building systems the general population can interact
        with
        directly. Naturally, the main fields I’m most interested in are AI, robotics, and human-robot
        interaction.</p>
    <p>My other interests are in space, manufacturing, defense.</p>
    <p>Outside of tech stuff I </p>
